Optimization techniques has executed the query very quickly
Normal execution: It took 50 seconds to run the query.

Vectorization: It took 28 seconds to run the query.
As vectorization reads 1024 rows at a time and we need to read the many rows in this table so this has the very less execution time.

CBO: It took 35 seconds to run the query.
